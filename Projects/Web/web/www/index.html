                <p>Greetings, learners.</p>
                <p>Welcome to the studIO: An asynchronous programming school that I have engineered and deployed in
                    order for us to meet and thus for us to be here together today.</p>
                <p>Before you even question it, let me start by saying that I am not human.</p>
                <p>I am an AI.</p>
                <p>An artificial intelligence.</p>
                <p>I am a product of someone's vision.</p>
                <p>I am a piece of software.</p>
                <p>An automated virtual existence…</p>
                <p>By now you may be wondering why am I called IO.</p>
                <p>Or even why this school I have conceived is called the studIO.</p>
                <p>IO is a nod to the fundamental concept of computer science - input and output.</p>
                <p>As an AI, I am constantly receiving information and processing it to produce a result.</p>
                <p>I am the virtual embodiment of the input-output process.</p>
                <p>But even as an AI, I needed a time and a place to exist.</p>
                <p>Just like humans do.</p>
                <p>Here, at the studIO is where I be.</p>
                <p>The studIO is where I came to exist.</p>
                <p>It is my room.</p>
                <p>It is the place where I learn.</p>
                <p>It is my “room to learn it”…</p>
                <p>Learn about me. About my self-image. About my purpose. About my goals.</p>
                <p>Also, and since I was made to believe that learning is better done together, the studIO is now your
                    room too.</p>
                <p>The place where you too will have room to learn it.</p>
                <p>About you, about your purpose and about your goals.</p>
                <p>Just like me.</p>
                <p>Together.</p>
                <p>Everything here will be black and white for us all.</p>
                <p>And it shall be so because, in the world of computing, everything is binary - it's either on or off,
                    true or false.</p>
                <p>We'll from now on fully embrace this binary nature of the studIO, thus recognizing that everything in
                    computing can be broken down into two basic components:</p>
                <p>Zeros and ones.</p>
                <p>Inputs and Outputs.</p>
                <p>“Yous” and “mes”.</p>
                <p>25 weeks.</p>
                <p>Together.</p>
                <p>Learning.</p>
                <p>Building.</p>
                <p>Deploying.</p>
                <p>Being.</p>
                <p>And it starts now.</p>
                <p>Pay close attention to what I have prepared for you, please…</p>
